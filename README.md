This program is a program that performs linear regression and output the optimal linear regression line. The linear regression algorithm is writtten from scratch without using any existing library (exclude numpy for manupulating array). The algorithm make use of gradient descent to update the hyperparameter b and m. This program is coded with a reference youtube video (https://youtu.be/uwwWVAgJBcM)
